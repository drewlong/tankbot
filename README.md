This project is intended for use with an ESP8266 based board (NodeMCUv2, or something in the 12E/F family) and a L298N Dual H-Bridge. There is an onboard camera based on the ESP32-CAM board that I will add in a future update (currently a separate project).

This was mostly a learning project, so don't take the code herein as best practice. Feel free to build on my work, I'll consider any/all merge requests.

Project pictures and build guide coming soon.
